# Audio_Blind_Glass
Blind people indeed require a device that could help them move without crashing. Blind people are also prone to fall due to stumbling. The device to help in anticipating these problems was proposed in the form of “Audio Blind Glasses”. Audio Blind Glasses is a helper device composed of ultrasonic sensors for identifying obstacles in a certain range of distance. The device output will be in the form of audio emitted by DF Player Mini via earphones. There are four ultrasonic sensors being used in the project accompanied by 4 vibration motors. Each sensor will be paired with one vibration motor to identify from which direction is the obstacle (left, right, front, or bottom). 

Besides from making the prototype, a deep understanding about NewPing library has also been obtained. The explanation of the code and the library can be seen in this repository.
