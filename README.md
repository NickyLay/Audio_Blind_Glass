# Audio_Blind_Glass
Blind people indeed require a device that could help them move without crashing. Blind people are also prone to fall due to stumbling. The device to help in anticipating these problems was proposed in the form of “Audio Blind Glasses”. Audio Blind Glasses is a medical helper device composed of ultrasonic sensors for identifying obstacles in a certain range of distance and an MPU6050 accelerometer that could be configured to be acting as a fall detection sensor. The device output will be in the form of audio emitted by DF Player Mini via earphones. There are four ultrasonic sensors being used in the project accompanied by 4 vibration motors. Each sensor will be paired with one vibration motor to identify the from which direction is the obstacle (left, right, front, or bottom).
